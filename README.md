# Relational-database
Implementation of relational database with Java
#First part: 
Constructed the basic building block of a table: Tuples, implemented a simple Catalog that keeps track of what tables are currently in the database and provides a way to access them. Implemented HeapFiles which are the physical representation of the data in our database.
