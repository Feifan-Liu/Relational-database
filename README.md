# Relational-database
Implementation of relational database with Java
- First part:
Constructed the basic building block of a table: Tuples, implemented a simple Catalog that keeps track of what tables are currently in the database and provides a way to access them. Implemented HeapFiles which are the physical representation of the data in our database.
- Second part:
Implemented relational operations, implemented the operations themselves then used JSQLparser to help translate SQL queries into these relational operations, effectively allowing users to query the data stored on the server.
